### Intro
I have been a macOS user for at least 13 years. Lately all big techs are pushing AI into every aspect of our lives, everything we interact with seems to have embedded AI.

Computers are designed to execute tasks that we order them to execute, this is done with the help of the operating system which is the interface between the us humans and the hardware.

The most used OSes, Windows and macOS keep adding things that makes it "bloated", new versions will consume more memory than the previous one, and you need to buy a new machine to be compatible with all this AI stuff.

Even though these machines are labeled obsolete to run their OS if you install any Linux distro these machines are "revived" and they will keep working for a long time.

### Taking back control

I didn't want to purchase a new expensive Apple product so I decided it was time to build a desktop pc and finally migrate to Linux.

After some researching I decided Arch Linux was the best distro for me, it gave me the level of control I was looking for. I did a minimal install and I am really happy with it.

I installed Hyprland and configured everything the way I like and only the tools I want and that I need to work and study. No more bloated systems.

The link below is the guide I used for installing Arch.
